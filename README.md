The ability to accurately infer cardiac electrophysiological (EP) properties is key to improving arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we developed a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to predict how different myocardial EP parameters are modulated by anti-arrhythmic drugs. Using in vitro optical mapping images and the 3-channel Fenton-Karma model, we estimated the changes in ionic channel conductance caused by these drugs. Our framework successfully characterised the action of drugs HMR1556, nifedipine and lidocaine - respectively, blockade of IK, ICa, and INa currents - by estimating that they decreased the respective channel conductance by 31.8±2.7% (p=8.2×10−5), 80.9±21.6% (p=0.02), and 8.6±0.5% (p=0.03), leaving the conductance of other channels unchanged. For carbenoxolone, whose main action is the blockade of intercellular gap junctions, PINNs also successfully predicted no significant changes (p>0.09) in all ionic conductances. Our results are an important step towards the deployment of PINNs for model parameter estimation from experimental data, bringing this framework closer to clinical or laboratory images analysis and for the personalisation of mathematical models.
